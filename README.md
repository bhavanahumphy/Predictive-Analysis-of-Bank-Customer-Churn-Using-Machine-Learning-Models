# Predictive-Analysis-of-Bank-Customer-Churn-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

# Abstract
Bank Customer Churn Classification is a project aimed at addressing customer turnover in the banking sector using machine learning and predictive analytics. The dataset includes historical customer data with attributes such as demographics, transaction history, and customer behavior. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of identifying customers likely to churn, enabling banks to take proactive measures to enhance customer retention.

The project involves several key stages: data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and evaluation of machine learning models. Techniques like SMOTE were employed to address data imbalance, and advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees were evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with superior accuracy and feature interpretability.

Insights from the analysis revealed significant factors influencing churn, such as age and geographical location, providing actionable recommendations for targeted marketing and improved customer service. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in the banking sector.
